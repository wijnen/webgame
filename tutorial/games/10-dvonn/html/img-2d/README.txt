This directory exists to force python-webgame to create a 2-D game.  If nothing
is specified, only 3-D is available.  If a directory with the -2d suffix is
present, only 2-D is available.  If there is also a directory with the -3d
suffix, both options are available.

Files in directories with such a suffix are only available to the version that
corresponds to their suffix.  In other words, images in this directory can only
be used in the 2-D version of the game.

Because this game only uses generated images, this directory is empty.  Its
reason for existing is solely to force the system into 2-D mode.
