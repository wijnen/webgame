Description: Framework for web based multiplayer games
 This program does most of the work of building a multi-player web based game.
 Only the game rules need to be written in a Python program, the interface
 needs to be defined in javascript, and the graphics and sounds need to be
 created.  It uses the Midnight Graphics and Recreation Library (m.grl) for
 presentation, so it is easy to make 2-D or 3-D games.
