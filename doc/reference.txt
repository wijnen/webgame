# This information is outdated. It will be removed or rewritten.

# Reference for webgame gpy files

## Globals defined by game, used by the system:

name: optional, str.
	Game name. Defaults to program name.

autokill: optional, bool.
	If True, kill game when last connection is closed.

num_players: required, int or tuple of two ints.
	Number of players. If this is an int, the game requires exactly that
	number. With two ints, those are minimum and maximum values. If the
	maximum value is None, there is no upper limit.

commands: optional, dict of str:callable.
	Commands that can always be called remotely. The list initially
	contains only "leave", which allows clients to exit the game and return
	to the title "game". If specified, these commands are added to the
	list. It is possible, but not recommended, to override the "leave"
	command.

Game: required, class with game rules definition.
	Details below.

Title: optional, class with title screen "game" rules definition.
	Defaults to simple game starting server. Syntax is identical to that of
	Game.


# The Game class

Properties that are injected into a Game class when it is created:

launch(task: generator, name: str, run_now: bool)
	launches a new task. If run_now is False (the default), it starts when
	the program returns to the main loop. Otherwise it is started before
	the call returns.
	
	Returns the new task.

broadcast
	calling a property of this will make a broadcast to all clients that
	are in this Game instance.

add_player()
	Add a player to this game. It does not initially have a connection.
	Returns the new player number.

remove_player(p: int)
	Remove a player from this game. Note that if removing anyone other than
	the last player, this will renumber the existing players, which may not
	work well.

Public: Shared_Object
	This object is shared with all game clients.
	Initial properties:
		name: str
			the game name (this is the empty string for the title game)
		players: list of dicts
			contains public information about all players.
			each dict contains a 'name':str item which is
			maintained by the system.  The game can add more data.

		For the title game only:
		
		games: list of str
			list of all running games
		title: str
			the name of this game (not any instance)
		min_players: int
			the minimum number of players
		max_players: int
			the maximum number of players, or None if there is no limit.

players: list of Player objects
	server side player data
	Player objects contain:
		Private: Shared_Object
			This object is shared with the controlling player
			System-maintained properties:
				actions: list of str
					All actions that can currently be
					invoked by this player, except actions
					that are always allowed.

now: int
	current time, updated whenever a task is resumed.

Properties that can be defined in the Game class that will be called:

player_added(p: int)
	Called after add_player is done creating a new player.

player_removed(p: int)
	Caled just before remove_player will remove a player.


# Yield arguments

yield is called with a dict, list, tuple, set, frozenset, int, float or str argument.
If the argument is not a dict, it is converted into a dict as follows:

If the argument is Task, int, float or str, it is changed into a list of one element.

If the argument is not a dict, each element is inserted into the dict:

If it is a str or Task, as value: None
Otherwise, as None: value

The dict can contain a None key, which must have a numerical value. This is the timeout (in seconds).
Other keys should be str. Those are functions that can be called by remote clients.

The value of an item with a str key is:
- None: all clients can call the function.
- int: only this client can call the function.
- list, tuple, set or frozenset: only these clients can call the function.

The value of an item with a Task key is irrelevant. The caller will be resumed
when the referenced Task is finished. It's return value is passed to the send() call.
